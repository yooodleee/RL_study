## **For what?**
---

Reinforcement Learning(RL) has emerged as one of the most promising fileds in artificial intelligence, enabling autonomous agents to make sequential decisions in complex environments. With its applications spanning robotics, game playing, finance, and scientific research, mastering RL is crucial for developing intelligent systems capable of learning from interactions.

This README serves as a detailed roadmap of my RL journey-covering the algoruthms i have motivations for exploring RL, and my long-term research aspirations. My goal is not just to understand existing RL techniques but also to push the boundaries of the filed by developing novel, ensemble-based models that leverged diverse learning strategies.

## **Motivation & Research Vision**
---

My primary interst lies in developing models capable of handling **anomalous**, 
**non-standard environments** where traditional RL algorithms mights struggle. I am particularly intersted in **ensemble RL**, **multi-agent cooperation and competition**, and 
**hierarchical decision-making**. My vision is to create **self-improving multi-agent systems**
that dynamically adapt and optimize their strategies through collaboration and competition.

Ultimately, my research goal is to build an **autonomous**, **meta-learning-driven AI system**
capable of finding optimal policies in dynamically changing environments. This involves ingergrating reinforcement learning with **game theory**, **meta-learning**, 
**evolutionary strategies**, and **variational inference techniques**.

## **Study RL Algorithms**
---

To lay a strong foundation for my research, I have systematically studied the following RL alrgorithms:

  1. **Value-based Methods**
     * **Q-Learning**: Fundamental tabular RL algorithm for discrete action spaces.
     * **Deep Q-Network(DQN)**: Extension of Q-learning using deep neural networks for function approximation.
     * **Rainbow DQN**: A combination of DQN extensions, including Double DQN, Dueling Networks, Noisy Nets, and Prioritized Experience Replay.

  2. **Policy-Based Methods**
     * **Policy Gradient(REINFORCE)**: Monte Carlo-based method for optimizing policy directly.
     * **Actor-Critic(A2C & A3C)**: Combines value estimation with policy optimization for stability and efficiency.
     * **Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO)**: Popular on-policy algorithm balancing sample efficiency and robustness.
     * **Trus Region Policy Optimization(TRPO)**: A more constrained policy optimization technique for stable updates.

  3. **Advanced RL Architectures**

     * **Monte Carlo Tree Serach(MCTS)**: Used in AlphaGo for structured decision-making in large action spaces.
     * **IMPALA(Importance-Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture)**: Distributed RL framework for scaling training across multiple agents.
     * **R2D2(Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed RL)**: Extends DQN with LSTMs for handling partial observability.

  4. **AlphaGO & Beyond**

     I have started analyzing **AlphaGo**, **AlphaZero**, and their underlying methodologies, with the goal of implementing them and using their techniques in **ensemble-based RL models**.

## **Next steps: Towards an Advanced Ensemble RL Model**
---

With a strong foundation in RL, I an now focusing on:

1. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**: Studying cooperative and competitive agent interactions.
2. **Ensemble Learning in RL**: Exploring hybrid models that combine multiple learning paradigms (e.g., **DQN + MCST**, **PPO + Evolutionary Strategies**).
3. **Hierarchical & Meta Reinforcement Learning**: Investigating **meta-learning** techniques for adaptable policies.
4. **Game Theory and Reward Optimization**: Applying **multi-agent negotiation and Nash equilibria** for optimal decision-making.

The ultimate gaol is to develop diverse ensemble RL system capable of adapting to diverse tasks and environments, leveraging multiple learning strategies.
